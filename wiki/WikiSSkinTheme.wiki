You can use high quality SSkin themes that are already available (*free* or *paid*) on the Android Market

NOTE:

 SSkin themes are not made for !NemusLauncher and they are supposed to be used along with
their dedicated "SSkin Butterfly Launcher". NemusLauncher is just another "compatible" launcher
for the SSkin themes and does not guarantee full functionality for the SSkin themes.

 Currently the SSkin themes from Android market require 'SSkin Butterfly Launcher'
as prerequisite at their installation time, that you need to install 'SSkin Butterfly Launcher' first
to use them with NemusLauncher.
